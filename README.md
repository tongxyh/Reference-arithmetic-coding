Reference arithmetic coding
===========================

This project is a clear implementation of arithmetic coding, suitable as a reference for
educational purposes. It is provided only in Python now and is open source.

The code can be used for study, and as a solid basis for modification and extension.
Consequently, the codebase optimizes for readability and avoids fancy logic,
and does not target the best speed/memory/performance.

The 'pmf' should be a pure python instance (which means it's not from any other package like numpy)
